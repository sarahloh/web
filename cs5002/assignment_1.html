	<dl>
		<dt>ST5005 Introduction to Probability and Statistics</dt>
		<br>
		<dd>
			On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:
			<ul>
				<li>Summarize data distributions using frequency tables and graphs;</li>
				<li>Interpret and choose between alternate measures of centrality and spread;</li>
